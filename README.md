# AzureChallengeHRFunction

The web application when the employee ID is provided, it sends web request to a function that will provide the user information. The function is a HTTP trigger developed in C#.

The project is ready to work.

In the case you are not using visual studio to deploy your function, take into account that the needed code to upload to Azure Portal is on the following files:
- HrLeaveRequestListFunction.cs
- LeaveRequest.cs

(You will need to merge both in one if you upload code manually to Azure Portal)
